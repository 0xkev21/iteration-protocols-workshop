# JavaScript Iteration protocol workshop

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/lmammino/iteration-protocols-workshop/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lmammino/iteration-protocols-workshop/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

A workshop about JavaScript iteration protocols: iterator, iterable, async iterator, async iterable by [@loige](https://twitter.com/loige). 😎

> I also have a workshop about [Node.js Streams](https://github.com/lmammino/streams-workshop).


## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 16+
- NPM 8+
- A text editor of your choice
- A bash-compatible shell


## Getting started

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to get all the necessary dependencies.

The workshop is divided in chapters and the first chapter starts at [01-intro](/01-intro/README.md).

Every chapter will teach you a specific iteration concept and offer you some examples and exercises to familiarize with that concept.

You will often find 2 different types of interactive actions:

  - 🎭 **PLAY** : commands or instructions you should spend some time with to get familiar with some concepts or APIs

  - 🏹 **Exercise**: when you have to use some of the concepts you just learned to solve a programming problem. Generally every exercise will have a test that you can run to validate your solution.

Enjoy! 🙃

If you like this piece of work, consider supporting me by getting a copy of [Node.js Design Patterns, Third Edition](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/), which also goes into great depth about Streams and related design patterns.

If you already have this book, **please consider writing a review** on Amazon, Packt, GoodReads or in any other review channel that you generally use. That would support us greatly 🙏.
