/*
  Do you remember when we saw that using for...of over an object would
  result into an error (objects are not inherently iterable)?

  We also saw that you can use `Object.entries` to create an iterable over the
  key/value pairs of an object.

  Let's pretend for a moment that `Object.entries` does not exist and let's
  reimplement something similar by ourselves.

  Write a function that takes an object as an argument and returns an iterable
  object that will produce all the key/value pairs of the original object.

  Note: using `Object.entries` is considered cheating.

  Run the tests with:

  > npm run ex -- 04-iterable-protocol/exercises/entries.test.js

*/

export function entriesIterable (obj) {
  // Your code here
}
