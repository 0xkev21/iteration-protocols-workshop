# 07 - Exercises

In this last section you will find some ideas of small projects and exercises that you can build to practice your acquired knowledge of JavaScript iteration protocols.

TODO: incremental find exercise
TODO: line iterator
TODO: enumerate utility
TODO: map utility
TODO: filter utility
TODO: fibonacci
TODO: batch utility
TODO: async iterator throttling


## Where to go from here

I hope you had fun with this workshop and that you also acquired some new practical learnings that you can bring to your next project.

If you want to keep learning about JavaScript, Node.js and iteration protocols, these are some interesting resources:

 - [Node.js Design Patterns, Third Edition](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/): has an entire section dedicated to iteration protocols and related design patterns (disclaimer: I co-authored this book!)
 - [JavaScript Async Iterator](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/blog/javascript-async-iterators/): An article that recaps most of the topics discussed in this workshop.
 - Learn [how I found a lost song using JavaScript and Async Iterators](https://youtu.be/uTzBHPpMEhA) (talk from No). You can also look at [the slides](https://loige.link/nodeconf-iter).
 - [Official (sync) Iteration protocols documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols): the goto place to make sure you didn't miss anything important about iteration protocols or just to quickly review something you don't remember.
 - [Official documentation about Async iterators and iterable on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator): Similar to the above but covers some details about the async counterparts of the iterator and iterable protocols.
 - [Official documentation about `for await ... of` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of): Gives you some more details about this syntax and when you can use it.

Let me know what you are going to build with your new acquired knowledge on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/loige), and you found this useful, please give it a star ‚≠êÔ∏è and share it with your friends and colleagues! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you! üëã
