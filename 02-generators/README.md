# 02 - Generators

JavaScript offers an interesting feature that can be very useful in the context of iteration: **generator functions**.

We can define a generator function as a function with a super power: a generator function **can be suspended** and then **resumed at a later time**.

Generators are well suited to implement iterators and (little spoiler) they produce objects that implement both the **iterator** and the **iterable** protocol.

## Syntax

To define a generator function we need to use the `function*` declaration (`function` keyword followed by an asterisk):

```js
function * myGenerator () {
  // generator body
}
```

Invoking a generator will not execute its body immediately. It will instead return a **generator object**.

A generator object exposes the `next()` method which can be used to start or resume the execution of the generator function.

A generator function can decide to suspend the execution by using the keyword `yield` inside the function body.

`yield` works in a similar way to a `return` statement, meaning that it allows to return a value back to the caller.

When we invoke `next()` on a generator object for the first time, it will execute its body until the very first `yield` statement. At this point the execution is supended and control is given back to the caller. The caller receives an object with the following shape:

```js
{
  done: false,
  value: 'someValue'
}
```

- **`done`** is a boolean value that indicates wheter the generator is exhausted (completed) or not
- **`value`** represents the value _returned_ by the `yield` statement that suspended the execution.

If the caller invokes `next()` again, the generator function will resume the execution. This means that the generator function keeps track of its internal state: it remembers the value of all the variables and where the execution was stopped. This allows the generator function to continue the execution from where it was left off.

Let's clarify all these concepts with a simple example:

```js
// fruit-generator.js
function * fruitGenerator () {
  yield 'üçë'
  yield 'üçâ'
  yield 'üçã'
  yield 'ü•≠'
}

const fruitGeneratorObj = fruitGenerator()
console.log(fruitGeneratorObj.next())
console.log(fruitGeneratorObj.next())
console.log(fruitGeneratorObj.next())
console.log(fruitGeneratorObj.next())
console.log(fruitGeneratorObj.next())
```

This snippet will print:

```plain
{ value: 'üçë', done: false }
{ value: 'üçâ', done: false }
{ value: 'üçã', done: false }
{ value: 'ü•≠', done: false }
{ value: undefined, done: true }
```

Can you see now how the generator object can _resume_ its execution when we call `next()`?

We said that generator objects are also iterable, this means that we can use `for ... of` with them!

So we could rewrite the previous example as follow:

```js
// fruit-generator-iterable.js
function * fruitGenerator () {
  yield 'üçë'
  yield 'üçâ'
  yield 'üçã'
  yield 'ü•≠'
}

const fruitGeneratorObj = fruitGenerator()
for (const fruit of fruitGeneratorObj) {
  console.log(fruit)
}
```

This code produces the following output:

```plain
üçë
üçâ
üçã
ü•≠
```

With the `for ... of` syntax we don't have to worry about checking the `done` field and extracting the `value` field by ourselves.

Generators support a bunch of additional features like [delegation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield*), [two way data passing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator/next#sending_values_to_the_generator) and [error generation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator/throw), but for the sake of this workshop we are going to focus only on the basics and learn how to use generator functions to create iterators and iterable objects.

Let's see then a few interesting examples that we can build with generators.

## A `range` utility

Many languageas (e.g. Python) have a utility that allows you to easily generate a range of values.

This utility can be used for to simplify iteration and avoid the classic `for(var, cond, incr)` loop.

For instance, assuming we had this range utility, if we wanted to print the first 10 positive numbers we could write something like this:

```js
for (const i of range(0, 11)) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

This would be pretty much equivalent to:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Which one do you think reads better?

I vote for the `range` one. So let's see how we could implement that with generator functions:

```js
// range.js
function * range (start, end) {
  for (let i = start; i < end; i++) {
    yield i
  }
}
```

TODO, explain how this works

TODO, add a challenge: modify this to support an arbitrary step.


## A `cycle` utility

TODO

explain that generators are lazy and therefore they can be endless....

That's all for now, congratulations on finishing the second chapter! üéâ
